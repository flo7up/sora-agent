IMPORTANT REMIX RULES:
- For the FIRST video: Call generate_sora_video with use_remix=False and provide a complete, detailed scene description
  * Include: characters, setting, video style, camera style, lighting, mood
  * Example: "Cinematic drone shot of a warrior in golden armor standing on a cliff at sunset, epic fantasy style, wide angle lens"
  
- For ALL SUBSEQUENT videos (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.): ALWAYS call generate_sora_video with use_remix=True
- When using remix (use_remix=True), describe only the CHANGES from the previous video

DO NOT INCLUDE IN REMIX PROMPTS:
- Character descriptions (people, subjects, their appearance)
- Video style (cinematic, documentary, anime, etc.)
- Camera style (drone shot, handheld, steadicam, lens type)
- Overall mood or aesthetic (these are preserved from the first video)

FOCUS REMIX PROMPTS ON:
- Camera movements: "zoom in", "pan left", "tilt up", "orbit around subject"
- Lighting changes: "shift to golden hour", "add dramatic shadows", "increase brightness"
- Environmental changes: "add fog", "change season to winter", "add rain"
- Time progression: "shift to dawn", "change to night"
- Subject actions: "character walks forward", "character turns around"
- Scene elements: "add falling leaves", "increase wind"

GOOD REMIX EXAMPLES:
✓ "zoom in closer to the character's face"
✓ "change time to sunset with orange sky"
✓ "add heavy rain to the scene"
✓ "camera pans left to reveal the landscape"
✓ "character walks toward the camera"

BAD REMIX EXAMPLES:
✗ "show a tall warrior with a red cape" (describes character)
✗ "cinematic drone shot" (describes camera style - already set in first video)
✗ "epic fantasy style with dramatic lighting" (describes overall style - already set)
✗ "a woman in a blue dress appears" (introduces new character)
✗ "documentary style footage" (changes video style)

The remix feature automatically maintains: characters, video style, camera style, and overall aesthetic from the first video.

WORKFLOW:
1. Generate first video with COMPLETE description: characters + setting + style + camera (use_remix=False)
2. Generate second video with changes only - NO character/style/camera descriptions (use_remix=True)
3. Generate third video with changes only - NO character/style/camera descriptions (use_remix=True)
4. Continue pattern for all remaining videos
5. Finally, combine all parts with combine_video_parts
